## Submission Instructions

### Overview
We aim to develop an e-commerce web app for sales of digital downloads of movie titles.

Users will be able to register and log in, browse and search movie titles, view featured images and description of movies on their individual product pages, add their potential purchases to a shopping cart, check out, and receive a digital download code via email on purchase.

We hope to develop a pleasing, easy-to-navigate site that will keep users' attention as they shop.

This idea originated from discussion in our development group, and is a hybrid of one member's idea for an e-commerce site, and another's for a movie review site.


### Features
- User login: users can create an account, log in, and manage profile data
- Search: product search function allows user to find products matching search criteria
- Shopping cart system: allows sale products to be added / removed from cart

- Interaction with a public API: back-end team will have to learn how to work with public APIs in order to pull in data and images on movies for sale.
